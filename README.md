# Flutter Weather App

Welcome to the Flutter Weather App! This is a small app developed as part of a hiring process that displays the weather of the current location after user authentication. The app supports both mobile and web platforms.

## Features

- **User Authentication:** Basic user authentication without a backend.
- **Current Location Weather:** Displays the weather information for the current location using the OpenWeather API.
- **Responsive Design:** The app supports both web and mobile web designs.

## Requirements

The app was developed to meet the following requirements:

- Implement user authentication (without a backend).
- Show the weather information of the current location using an API (OpenWeather API).
- Support both mobile and web platforms.
- Complete the project within 72 hours of receiving the email.

## Development

The app was developed in less than 72 hours, from start to finish. Given the tight timeline and that this was my first time using Flutter, I aimed to keep the app simple and straightforward, focusing on meeting the project requirements. Here's how I approached the development:

1. **Set Up the Project:** Started by setting up the Flutter project and configuring it for mobile and web platforms.

2. **User Authentication:** Implemented a basic user authentication flow to fulfill the requirement. For simplicity, I used a mocked user email and password. 
***The mocked e-mail is user@gmail.com and password is 12345 ***

3. **Location Access:** Integrated a location service to get the user's current location.

4. **Weather Information:** Used the OpenWeather API to fetch the current weather information based on the user's location.

5. **UI Design:** Designed a simple and responsive UI for both mobile and web platforms.

6. **Testing and Deployment:** Thoroughly tested the app on both platforms and finalized the project.

## How to Run

To run the app, make sure you have Flutter installed. Then follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository

2. Change to the project directory

3. Run the app:

    - For web, use the command:

        ```bash
        flutter run -d chrome
        ```

## Conclusion

This project was my first experience using Dart/Flutter, and I found it amazing. 
Despite the tight timeline and most of it being during weekdays, I fulfilled the requiements successfully.
Flutter will going forward be something I always consider when developing cross-platform, especially since I'm not a fan of CSS. 

Thank you for the opportunity to work on this project!
